Tesla has announced that the original Tesla Fleet API OAuth endpoint is being deprecated on August 1st, 2025.

Home Assistant has been updated to use the new OAuth endpoint in 2025.7.4, which means all previous versions of Home Assistant will fail to authentication with Tesla after August 1st, 2025.

Please update to 2025.7.4 or later to continue using the Tesla Fleet integration.
